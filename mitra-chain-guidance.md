Of course. I've updated the architecture guide to include a new section detailing the specific pages and the overall user flow for the MitraChain platform.

Here is the complete, updated guidance.

# MitraChain: Feature & Data Architecture

This document outlines the core features, user roles, data architecture, and page structure for **MitraChain**, a Web3 marketplace connecting franchise owners with prospective business partners on the Internet Computer.

---

## 1. üèõÔ∏è Core Vision & Architecture

MitraChain's vision is to create a transparent, efficient, and user-owned platform for the franchise industry. It will empower both franchisors to expand their network and entrepreneurs to find and launch their ideal business.

The platform will run entirely on the Internet Computer (ICP), with a **Motoko** backend for logic and data, a **React** frontend for the user interface, and multi-wallet support for secure, decentralized authentication and asset management. Governance will eventually be handed over to the community via an **SNS DAO**.

## 2. üë• User Roles

The platform is designed for three primary roles:

1.  **Franchisor (The Business Owner):** An entity or individual who owns a franchise brand and wants to find partners to open new locations. Their goal is to showcase their brand and manage applications from potential franchisees.
2.  **Franchisee (The Investor/Operator):** An entrepreneur or investor looking for business opportunities. Their goal is to discover, research, and apply for franchises that match their interests and budget.
3.  **Platform DAO (The Community):** Initially the admin, but eventually the community of token holders who will govern the platform, vote on new features, and manage platform-wide parameters like listing fees.
